  Description: "Codex Entry: The Bibliophage                    Origin: Once a scholar
    obsessed with forbidden knowledge, the Bibliophage was consumed by the very texts
    it sought to master. Ancient tomes whisper of a cursed manuscript, its pages
    inked in suffering, binding itself to those who read too deeply. The scholar,
    now a wretched husk, wanders in search of more knowledge to devour, though it
    no longer comprehends the words it once cherished.                    Description:
    A gaunt, decayed figure, its flesh stretched thin over brittle bones. A heavy
    tome is fused to its face, its pages stitched into the creature\u2019s very being,
    leaking ink like coagulated blood. It moves erratically, guided by unseen hands,
    its whispers a maddening chorus of forgotten languages.                    Behavior:
    The Bibliophage stalks the dim corridors of abandoned libraries, forgotten archives,
    and ruined academies. It is drawn to the scent of ink and parchment, attacking
    any who dare disturb its eternal study. Those who meet its gaze through the cracks
    in the book\u2019s pages feel their thoughts unravel, their minds rewritten with
    words not meant for human understanding."
