  Description: "Codex Entry: The Gnawing One                     Origin: Deep beneath
    the city streets, where the tunnels stretch beyond memory, something festers.
    Some say it was once human\u2014an outcast forced into the dark, feeding on filth
    until it became filth itself. Others believe it is older than the city, a primordial
    hunger that lurks beneath every civilization. Whatever the truth, the Gnawing
    One does not simply survive in the underworld\u2014it reigns.                     
    Description: A grotesque fusion of rodent and nightmare, its flesh is stretched
    tight over wiry muscles, pocked with festering sores. Its eyeless face twists
    into a permanent snarl, jagged teeth gnashed together in endless hunger. Slick,
    sinewy arms end in long, grasping claws, capable of rending flesh and burrowing
    through stone. It does not need to see. It smells. It feels. It knows you are
    here.                      Behavior: The Gnawing One is never alone. Where it
    lingers, so do the lesser things\u2014the vermin, the carrion eaters, the wretched
    husks of what it leaves behind. It hunts through tunnels and forgotten corridors,
    its breath rattling in the dark. It does not kill for sport; it consumes, dragging
    its prey into unseen depths where their screams will never rise. Those who hear
    its chattering in the walls would do well to leave before it comes to collect."
