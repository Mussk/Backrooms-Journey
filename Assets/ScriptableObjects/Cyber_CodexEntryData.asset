  Description: "Codex Entry: The Bound Ones                     Origin: There was
    a time when they were two\u2014brothers. Their fate was sealed when they were
    taken by the surgeons of the Machine Cult, who saw no use for the individual
    when two could become one. Flesh was fused, nerves rewired, and minds forced
    into unholy synchronicity. Now, they roam as a single abomination, bound in agony,
    their thoughts tangled like exposed circuitry.                      Description:
    A grotesque fusion of flesh and metal, two bodies stitched together at the spine,
    their torsos twisted into an unnatural symmetry. One head twitches erratically,
    its mouth sewn shut, while the other screams with a voice full of static. Cybernetic
    limbs extend where flesh once was, grafted from rusted machinery and sparking
    with unstable energy. Their mismatched hands grasp at unseen pain, their shared
    body moving in an erratic, lurching rhythm.                      Behavior: The
    Bound Ones are unpredictable, their dual consciousness forever at war. One half
    is calculated, methodical, seeking to trap prey with cold precision. The other
    is rage incarnate, lashing out in chaotic fury. Together, they hunt with unsettling
    coordination, speaking in fragmented transmissions and corrupted speech. To see
    them is to be seen, for their mechanical eyes record all, transmitting unknown
    data to unknown masters."
