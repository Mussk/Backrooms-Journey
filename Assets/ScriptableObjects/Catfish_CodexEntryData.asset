  Description: "Codex Entry: The Murkborn                     Origin: Legends speak
    of a drowned village, swallowed by a rising swamp after its people defiled sacred
    waters. The Murkborn are said to be the cursed remnants of that lost settlement\u2014twisted,
    amphibious horrors that lurk beneath the reeds. Neither man nor beast, they have
    forgotten their former selves, bound only by an insatiable hunger for the living.                     
    Description: A towering, grotesque hybrid of humanoid and catfish, its slick,
    mottled skin glistens with swamp filth. Its mouth is lined with rows of needle-like
    teeth, perpetually stretched into a grotesque, knowing grin. Long, webbed claws
    grasp a crude spear, fashioned from bone and driftwood, a tool for dragging prey
    into the depths. Its bulging, lidless eyes reflect no light\u2014only the abyss.                     
    Behavior: The Murkborn are ambush predators, lurking in the murky shallows or
    beneath wooden docks, waiting in eerie stillness. They move with unsettling speed
    when striking, spearing victims before hauling them into the swamp\u2019s black
    embrace. When not hunting, they murmur in guttural croaks\u2014echoes of a language
    long lost to the bog."
