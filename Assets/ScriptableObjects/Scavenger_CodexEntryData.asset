  Description: "Codex Entry: The Chitin Reaper                     Origin: No one
    knows where it came from. Some claim it is the last remnant of an ancient, insectoid
    race that once ruled the underworld, now reduced to a single vengeful survivor.
    Others whisper that it was made\u2014a fusion of flesh and weapon, grown in a
    forgotten laboratory where evolution was forced upon unwilling hosts. Whatever
    the truth, the Chitin Reaper exists only for one purpose: to kill.                     
    Description: A towering, nightmarish insect-like creature with a grotesquely
    muscular frame, its skin stretched taut over fibrous, sinewy flesh. Unlike a
    true exoskeleton, its body is reinforced with hardened organic plating\u2014growths
    of thick, calcified bone-like material that pulse as if alive. Its arms end not
    in hands, but in jagged, scythe-like blades of exposed bone, sharpened to a cruel
    edge through endless slaughter. Its multi-faceted eyes reflect no emotion, only
    cold calculation. A hidden maw clicks and shudders beneath its armored face,
    unseen mandibles twitching in anticipation. It does not make a sound unless it
    wants you to hear it. And when you do, it is already too late.                     
    Behavior: The Chitin Reaper is a perfect predator, relying on speed and stealth
    to ambush its prey. It clings to walls, ceilings, and unseen crevices, its body
    shifting with unnatural grace. When it strikes, it does so with terrifying precision\u2014one
    blade to immobilize, the other to finish the job. It does not feast, does not
    linger. It simply moves on, searching for the next victim."
